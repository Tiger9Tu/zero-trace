### Introduction

### Dependencies: libbpf with CO-RE

To use BTF and CO-RE, `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y` and `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF_MODULES=y` need to be enabled. If you don't want to rebuild the kernel, the following distos have enabled those options by default:

- Ubuntu 20.10+
- Fedora 31+
- RHEL 8.2+
- Debian 11+

And to build bpf applications, the following development tools should also be installed:

```
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install -y make clang llvm libelf-dev linux-tools-$(uname -r)

# RHEL
sudo yum install -y make clang llvm elfutils-libelf-devel bpftool

# WSL2 
# bpftool which shall be compiled and installed from kernel souce code provided by Microsoft
# source code
